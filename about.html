      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1990 by Rodney J., Unique Ornamental Iron Inc. has grown from a small portable welding business into a family-run leader in the Southern California gate and fencing industry. With roots in metal fabrication passed down through generations, our team builds with passion, precision, and pride.

      <p>From beautifully crafted residential gates to durable commercial fencing solutions, our work is tailored to your vision â€” because if you can dream it, we can build it.</p>

      <p>Today, Rodney and his sons Ryan and Chad carry forward the values that started it all: integrity, craftsmanship, and a deep commitment to helping others.</p>

      <p>Made in the USA. Built to last. Powered by family.</p>
